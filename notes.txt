# SIDA setup steps

- Create VPS on Digital Ocean, or install Docker on on your server of choice.


Model training is based on two types of collections: media sets and label sets.

- Audio: ZIP file(s) containing MP3s, WAVs, and/or MP4 videos

- Labels: CSV file(s), 5 columns:

```
spe_1995_0423_clinton,40.0,1.0,"Bill Clinton","Stephen Reid McLaughlin"
spe_1995_1127_clinton,237.0,1.0,"Bill Clinton","Stephen Reid McLaughlin"
```

We can combine multiple ad hoc collections of labeled audio to train models, downsampling as needed to get the right balance.

Hand-labeled audio collections can be helpful, but it is necessary to do some data cleaning by choosing 1-second clips at random.
